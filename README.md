# Prime-Finder-2000-Pro
Finds primes at maximum speed!!

Download all the files.

"primelist.txt" is just a text file with the first few primes in it. Just leave it for now.

Open "primelister2.py"
This program is a slower way to find primes, but you don't need a backlog of numbers for it to work quickly.
When the program promts you for a limit, enter the number that you want it to generate primes up to. I recommend at least 50 000 000.

Once the program is finished, you can look at "primelist.txt". You should have a giant list of numbers.

Now that you have a backlog of primes, you can move on to "primelisterV3.py". This program locates the end of "primelist.txt" and continues finding primes from there. (as does the first program).
However, instead of dividing each number by every number up to its square root, it divides only by prime numbers.
This is why the first program was required: to generate primes to divide by.

Just open the program, and it will start going!!!
